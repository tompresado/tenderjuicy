            <h2>hi jay, i miss u, i know u blocked me, im sorry. i wrote this poem-- or what seems like it--for you</h2>
            <p>
                through rusted keys we talked, but through red threads they flew, perhaps only mine. <br>They whisper with the wind like conversations we never finished
                <br><br>
                i dont remember how or why, but i saw u let the wind take u. <br>How could i find u if i couldnt remember how u left? <br>How could i find someone that doesnt want to be found? 
                <br><br>
                Ill wait for the time when i can see ur smile while eating bibingka while we talk abt why we should be eating less. <br>I'll pay for it. but i could only dream for these things-- well if they were to happen,  <br>now that u left me, id be paying for myself, while i talk to myself. 
                <br><br>
                i hope u remember me, or just my name. When you play the games we played. Or when you hear the artists i play. <br>Ill remember the things we did, but ill be happy if u remember the first letter of my name, <br>or js the way it sounds. ill be happy. i will. ill be the eternal sunshine in ur spotless mind. <br>Mark me the villain in ur story, make a story of how bad i was and demonize me.<br> Ill be happy u remember me
                <br><br>
                well if thats what u want, what ur heart aches for in the darkest of nights: to leave. <br>Then ill wave bye to the ship u stand, while u look in front. I look at ur back, wondering why u dont wave back. <br><br>Like a dog, with a bird at ur door, ill wait til u appreciate me-- <br>at least the things i did for u.
                <br><br><br><br>
                i miss u, ik i sound corny. sorry tej i was overthinking, u even had to block me:/ i had to make an html for this haha<br>alr, ingat sa wte concert, this is the closest i'll get to listening to wte with u.  love u. <br><br>

               sincerely and wholeheartedly,<br> <i>Tom</i>
