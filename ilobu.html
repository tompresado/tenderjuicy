            <h2 class="fade-in">Hi Jay, I miss you. I know you blocked me, I'm sorry. I wrote this poem—or what seems like it—for you.</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">Through rusted keys we talked, but through red threads they flew, perhaps only mine. <br>They whisper with the wind like conversations we never finished.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">I don't remember how or why, but I saw you let the wind take you. <br>How could I find you if I couldn't remember how you left? <br>How could I find someone that doesn't want to be found?</p>
            <p class="fade-in">I'll wait for the time when I can see your smile while eating bibingka and we talk about why we should be eating less. <br>I'll pay for it. But I could only dream of these things... Now that you left me, I'll be paying for myself while I talk to myself.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">I hope you remember me, or just my name. When you play the games we played or hear the artists I play. <br>I'll remember the things we did, but I'll be happy if you remember the first letter of my name, <br>or just the way it sounds. I'll be happy. I will. I'll be the eternal sunshine in your spotless mind.<br>Mark me the villain in your story, make a story of how bad I was and demonize me.<br>I'll be happy you remember me.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">Well, if that's what you want, what your heart aches for in the darkest of nights: to leave. <br>Then I'll wave bye to the ship you stand on while you look ahead. I look at your back, wondering why you don't wave back. <br>Like a dog, with a bird at your door, I'll wait till you appreciate me—at least the things I did for you.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">I miss you. I know I sound corny. Sorry Tej, I was overthinking. You even had to block me. I had to make an HTML for this haha.<br>Alright, ingat sa WTE concert, this is the closest I'll get to listening to WTE with you. Love you.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">Sincerely and wholeheartedly,<br><i>Tom</i></p>
